## I. General Toxicity

*1. Toxicity and response*
- **title:** Immunotherapy: Auto-immune toxicity as a predictive factor of response.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_267517.html
- **conclusion:** 18% of the patients had irAEs. Patients with irAEs seemed to have better OS and PFS but no statistically difference was found. This trend is probably related to patients with late toxicity, which reflects the time of treatment and the increasing probability to develop an irAEs. In our study, early irAEs could not be considered as a reliable preemptive factor of response to immunotherapy.

*2. Toxicity in the clinic*
- **title:** Immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity in the clinical practice setting.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266535.html
- **link:** Overall, there was increased incidence in ICI toxicity in patients at this oncology institution versus what has been reported in clinical trials. Patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases appeared to have mainly low-grade toxicities with slightly increased incidence of irAE compared with those without pre-existing autoimmune disease. Treatment holds and hospitalizations were higher in patients treated with combination therapy ICIs compared to monotherapy ICIs.

## II. The Science Behind Adverse Events
  
		

## III. Neurological and Neuromuscular

*1. Cellular analysis of NM toxicity*
- **title:** Clinical and immunological analyses of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated neuromuscular (NM) toxicities.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_270999.html
- **conclusion:** NM irAEs occurred more frequently with combination ICI, and were associated with weakness, and elevated CK level and serum autoantibodies. Both T and B cells appear to drive disease pathogenesis. The presence of one toxicity on the spectrum warrants evaluation for associated irAEs. Compared to isolated NM irAEs, the overlap syndrome appears to be more treatment refractory. Current guidelines require refinement to identify effective treatments to improve outcomes.
		
## IV. Hepatitis

## V. Colitis

## VI. Cardiac

*1. Cardiac Toxicity*
- **title:** Cardiovascular complications of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_260643.html
- **conclusion:** Out of the reported cases of adverse reaction to check point inhibitor, 6.2% were cardio toxicities. 35% of cardio toxicities were fatal. Half of the cases who developed myocarditis died. There was no statistical difference in rate of cardiotoxicities caused by PD1, PDL1 or CTLA 4 inhibitors.

## XIV. Efforts at Predicting Toxicity

*1. Machine learning approach to prediction*
- **title:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict response and toxicity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in melanoma patients.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266079.html
- **conclusion:** Our results support the potential application of machine learning on pre-treatment histologic slides to predict response to ICIs. It also revealed their limited value in predicting toxicity. We are currently investigating whether the predictive capability of the algorithm can be further improved by incorporating additional immunologic biomarkers.
