Relevant abstracts for the MGH Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicity Group

## I. General Toxicity

*1. Toxicity and response*
- **title:** Immunotherapy: Auto-immune toxicity as a predictive factor of response.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_267517.html
- **conclusion:** 18% of the patients had irAEs. Patients with irAEs seemed to have better OS and PFS but no statistically difference was found. This trend is probably related to patients with late toxicity, which reflects the time of treatment and the increasing probability to develop an irAEs. In our study, early irAEs could not be considered as a reliable preemptive factor of response to immunotherapy.

*2. Toxicity in the clinic*
- **title:** Immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity in the clinical practice setting.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266535.html
- **link:** Overall, there was increased incidence in ICI toxicity in patients at this oncology institution versus what has been reported in clinical trials. Patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases appeared to have mainly low-grade toxicities with slightly increased incidence of irAE compared with those without pre-existing autoimmune disease. Treatment holds and hospitalizations were higher in patients treated with combination therapy ICIs compared to monotherapy ICIs.

*3. Updates on incidence and clinical pattern*
- **title:** Incidence and clinical pattern of immune related adverse effects (irAE) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_268623.html
- **conclusion:** irAEs on ICI therapy are very common. Awareness of the relative frequencies of various irAEs, particularly severe and rare irAEs, in a real-world setting can help improve quality of care for cancer patients receiving ICI.

*4. AE experience in Mexico*
- **title:** Prevalence of immunotherapy-related adverse events due to checkpoint inhibitors: First report in Mexico.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_255211.html
- **conclusion:**  The dermatological, gastrointestinal and endocrine toxicities were the most frequent ir-AE´s, and they were observed in a low grade toxicity. The irAE´s profile is different among ICI or their combination and number of cycles administered. Ipilimumab alone or combined was associated to higher risk of severe irAEs.

*5. Meta-analysis of toxicity*
- **title:**  living systematic review of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients: A novel platform for evidence synthesis in oncology.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_271655.html
- **conclusion:**  The meta-analysis updates previously published toxicity estimates and provides additional information about the risk of toxicities in single versus combination regimens. We have initiated the first living systematic review in oncology that will be continuously updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available, and will provide accurate and up to date toxicity estimates to support clinical decision making.

## II. The Science Behind Adverse Events

*1. Nivolumab's relationship with the microbiome*
- **title:** Gut microbiota and clinical outcomes treated with nivolumab in Chinese non-small cell lung cancer.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_253305.html
- **conclusion:** Strong correlation between the gut microbiome diversity and the responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in Chinese NSCLC patients regardless of genetic variation between Western and Chinese population. Patients with a favorable gut microbiome (such as high diversity) have enhanced immune responses mediated by effector T cell function in the periphery. These findings thus provide important implications for the prediction and the evaluation of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against NSCLC.

*2. Immune biomarkers may be tissue specific*
- **title:** Immunotherapy clinical trials suggest predictive immune-related biomarkers are tissue specific
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_271209.html
- **conclusion:** Our results suggest effective immunotherapy trials may require tissue-specific biomarker development. Further, a combination of immune signatures and biomarkers such as TMB shows markedly increased utility compared to single factor such as TMB, PD-1 or PD-L1 expression alone.

## III. Neurological and Neuromuscular

*1. Cellular analysis of NM toxicity*
- **title:** Clinical and immunological analyses of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated neuromuscular (NM) toxicities.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_270999.html
- **conclusion:** NM irAEs occurred more frequently with combination ICI, and were associated with weakness, and elevated CK level and serum autoantibodies. Both T and B cells appear to drive disease pathogenesis. The presence of one toxicity on the spectrum warrants evaluation for associated irAEs. Compared to isolated NM irAEs, the overlap syndrome appears to be more treatment refractory. Current guidelines require refinement to identify effective treatments to improve outcomes.
		
## IV. Hepatitis

*1. Meta-analysis of clinical trials for pancreatic, hepatic, and GI toxicity*
- **title:** Gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and hepatic toxicity profile of CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of clinical trials.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_272405.html
- **conclusion:** Though the overall GI, hepatic and pancreatic safety profile of CTLA-4 is comparable to C-ICPI, a higher incidence of high-grade colitis was found with CTLA-4. Two GI perforations were reported with CTLA-4 and warrant further investigation. No difference in treatment related mortality was found among the two groups.

## V. Colitis

*1. Colitis after resumption of immunotherapy*
- **title:** Immune-mediated colitis after resumption of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_264447.html
- **conclusion:** One-third of patients who resumed ICI treatment after IMDC experienced recurrent IMDC. IMDC recurrence was less frequent after resumption of anti–PD-1/L1 than after anti–CTLA-4. Characteristics of recurrent IMDC based on resumed ICI therapy.

*2. Immunosuppression therapy for colitis*
- **title:** Outcomes after early initiation of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive therapy in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_261383.html
- **conclusion:** NSIST should be introduced early in the disease course of IMC instead of waiting until failure of steroid therapy or steroid taper. Patients who received three or more infusions of NSIST had more favorable clinical outcomes.

*3. IBD variants among those with immunotherapy colitis*
- **title:** High prevalence of IBD-associated genetic variants in patients (pts) with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) enteritis/colitis.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266285.html
- **conclusion:** In this pilot study, all patients with ICI colitis, were either homozygous or heterozygous for two or more high risk IBD alleles. If validated, such testing may prospectively identify pts at risk for developing ICI colitis.

## VI. Cardiac

*1. Cardiac Toxicity*
- **title:** Cardiovascular complications of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_260643.html
- **conclusion:** Out of the reported cases of adverse reaction to check point inhibitor, 6.2% were cardio toxicities. 35% of cardio toxicities were fatal. Half of the cases who developed myocarditis died. There was no statistical difference in rate of cardiotoxicities caused by PD1, PDL1 or CTLA 4 inhibitors.

## VII. Hematology

*1. Hemolytic anemia in immunotherapy*
- **title:** Recurrent and de-novo autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patients treated with immunotherapy for advanced cancer.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_248567.html
- **conclusion:** The incidence of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with immunotherapy was low. Presence of alloAb at baseline may predict irAE during IO treatment as patients with positive alloAb at baseline had a higher rate of irAE than those without.

## IX. Endocrine

*1. Meta-analysis of endocrine adverse events*
- **title:** A comprehensive meta-analysis of endocrine immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors and outcomes in head and neck cancer and lung cancer.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_269251.html
- **conclusion:** ICPi are a powerful tool in the treatment of cancer. The prevalence of endocrine irAEs in this meta-analysis was 9%. There is evidence of improved overall survival in patients who developed endocrine irAEs. Further studies are needed to correlate the development of irAEs and OS advantage.

*2. Neck irradiation associated with thyroid dysfunction in patients receiving immunotherapy*
- **title:** Predictors and outcomes of thyroid dysfunction with immunotherapy: A single institution observational experience.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_261837.html
- **conclusion:** History of radiation therapy to neck is significantly associated with development of thyroid dysfunction in patients receiving immunotherapy. Thyroid replacement therapy is sufficient to bring down the levels of TSH and immunotherapy need not be interrupted.

## XIV. Efforts at Predicting Toxicity

*1. Machine learning approach to prediction*
- **title:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict response and toxicity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in melanoma patients.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266079.html
- **conclusion:** Our results support the potential application of machine learning on pre-treatment histologic slides to predict response to ICIs. It also revealed their limited value in predicting toxicity. We are currently investigating whether the predictive capability of the algorithm can be further improved by incorporating additional immunologic biomarkers.

*2. SNPs to predict irAEs*
- **title:** Genetic determinants of adverse events in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_270319.html
- **conclusion:** Genetic variants associated with irAEs were identified. Additional larger studies are needed to validate these findings, and to establish their potential functional relevance.
