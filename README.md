- **conclusion:** Out of the reported cases of adverse reaction to check point inhibitor, 6.2% were cardio toxicities. 35% of cardio toxicities were fatal. Half of the cases who developed myocarditis died. There was no statistical difference in rate of cardiotoxicities caused by PD1, PDL1 or CTLA 4 inhibitors.
