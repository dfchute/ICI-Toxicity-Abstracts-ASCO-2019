## I. General Toxicity

*1. Toxicity and response*
- **title:** Immunotherapy: Auto-immune toxicity as a predictive factor of response.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_267517.html
- **conclusion:** 18% of the patients had irAEs. Patients with irAEs seemed to have better OS and PFS but no statistically difference was found. This trend is probably related to patients with late toxicity, which reflects the time of treatment and the increasing probability to develop an irAEs. In our study, early irAEs could not be considered as a reliable preemptive factor of response to immunotherapy.

*2. Toxicity in the clinic*
- **title:** Immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity in the clinical practice setting.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266535.html
- **link:** Overall, there was increased incidence in ICI toxicity in patients at this oncology institution versus what has been reported in clinical trials. Patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases appeared to have mainly low-grade toxicities with slightly increased incidence of irAE compared with those without pre-existing autoimmune disease. Treatment holds and hospitalizations were higher in patients treated with combination therapy ICIs compared to monotherapy ICIs.

*3. Updates on incidence and clinical pattern*
- **title:** Incidence and clinical pattern of immune related adverse effects (irAE) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_268623.html
- **conclusion:** irAEs on ICI therapy are very common. Awareness of the relative frequencies of various irAEs, particularly severe and rare irAEs, in a real-world setting can help improve quality of care for cancer patients receiving ICI.

*4. AE experience in Mexico*
- **title:** Prevalence of immunotherapy-related adverse events due to checkpoint inhibitors: First report in Mexico.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_255211.html
- **conclusion:**  The dermatological, gastrointestinal and endocrine toxicities were the most frequent ir-AE´s, and they were observed in a low grade toxicity. The irAE´s profile is different among ICI or their combination and number of cycles administered. Ipilimumab alone or combined was associated to higher risk of severe irAEs.

*5. Meta-analysis of toxicity*
- **title:**  living systematic review of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients: A novel platform for evidence synthesis in oncology.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_271655.html
- **conclusion:**  The meta-analysis updates previously published toxicity estimates and provides additional information about the risk of toxicities in single versus combination regimens. We have initiated the first living systematic review in oncology that will be continuously updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available, and will provide accurate and up to date toxicity estimates to support clinical decision making.

## II. The Science Behind Adverse Events

		

## III. Neurological and Neuromuscular

*1. Cellular analysis of NM toxicity*
- **title:** Clinical and immunological analyses of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated neuromuscular (NM) toxicities.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_270999.html
- **conclusion:** NM irAEs occurred more frequently with combination ICI, and were associated with weakness, and elevated CK level and serum autoantibodies. Both T and B cells appear to drive disease pathogenesis. The presence of one toxicity on the spectrum warrants evaluation for associated irAEs. Compared to isolated NM irAEs, the overlap syndrome appears to be more treatment refractory. Current guidelines require refinement to identify effective treatments to improve outcomes.
		
## IV. Hepatitis

*1. Meta-analysis of clinical trials for pancreatic, hepatic, and GI toxicity*
- **title:** Gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and hepatic toxicity profile of CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of clinical trials.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_272405.html
- **conclusion:** Though the overall GI, hepatic and pancreatic safety profile of CTLA-4 is comparable to C-ICPI, a higher incidence of high-grade colitis was found with CTLA-4. Two GI perforations were reported with CTLA-4 and warrant further investigation. No difference in treatment related mortality was found among the two groups.

## V. Colitis

## VI. Cardiac

*1. Cardiac Toxicity*
- **title:** Cardiovascular complications of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_260643.html
- **conclusion:** Out of the reported cases of adverse reaction to check point inhibitor, 6.2% were cardio toxicities. 35% of cardio toxicities were fatal. Half of the cases who developed myocarditis died. There was no statistical difference in rate of cardiotoxicities caused by PD1, PDL1 or CTLA 4 inhibitors.

## XIV. Efforts at Predicting Toxicity

*1. Machine learning approach to prediction*
- **title:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict response and toxicity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in melanoma patients.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_266079.html
- **conclusion:** Our results support the potential application of machine learning on pre-treatment histologic slides to predict response to ICIs. It also revealed their limited value in predicting toxicity. We are currently investigating whether the predictive capability of the algorithm can be further improved by incorporating additional immunologic biomarkers.

*2. SNPs to predict irAEs*
- **title:** Genetic determinants of adverse events in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- **link:** http://abstracts.asco.org/239/AbstView_239_270319.html
- **conclusion:** Genetic variants associated with irAEs were identified. Additional larger studies are needed to validate these findings, and to establish their potential functional relevance.
